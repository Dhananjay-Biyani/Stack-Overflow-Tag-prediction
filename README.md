# Stack-Overflow-Tag-prediction
The Stack Overflow Tag Predictor is a project aimed at predicting the appropriate tags for questions posted on the Stack Overflow platform. 
It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which provides a collection of questions along with their corresponding tags.
The project encompasses several steps, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, and the application of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique for feature extraction. 
Additionally, the One-vs-Rest classifier has been implemented for tag prediction.

NOTE:
The actual dataset files have not been uploaded to the repository due to their large size. However, you can obtain the dataset from Kaggle
